This is a work in progress for stickering LEGO part bags categorized by
shape and color. At the moment it's mostly for my own amusement.

Let me know if you find it useful or have any ideas.

Files referenced by the program should be placed near the running binary
and can be acquired from https://rebrickable.com/downloads/ .

Since Rebrickable needs level 3 to even report incorrect information, but
they don't really provide easy ways to figure out what to do to get there,
I've decided instead reporting the bug to add extra data into my system
to correct it.

These files are located in the datafix folder.
