This is a work in progress for stickering LEGO part bags categorized by
shape and color. At the moment it's mostly for my own amusement.

Let me know if you find it useful or have any ideas.

Files referenced by the program should be placed near the running binary
and can be acquired from https://rebrickable.com/downloads/ .
